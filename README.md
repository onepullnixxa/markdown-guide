# Bash Commands Cheatsheet

As my first assignment in GA, I'll be creating a quick document to reference some common Bash commands.

## Most Common Commands
- `pwd` : display the current directory
- `cd` : changes the directory you're in
- `ls` : allows you to view a list of all files in the current directory
  - `ls -a` : display all files (and hidden files) in the current directory
- `mkdir` : create a new directory
- `touch` : create a new file
- `clear` : clear the terminal
